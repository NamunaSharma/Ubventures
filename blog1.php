        <p>One of the biggest mistakes a venture capitalist can make is trying to be the smartest person at the table. It’s tempting. VCs are trained to analyze, to pattern-match, to spot trends and apply frameworks. The job often looks like it rewards confidence and conviction. But in some of the hardest corners of innovation, especially drug discovery, that mindset doesn’t just fall short. It can lead you straight into failure.</p>

<p>In biotech, there are no crystal balls. There’s no consistent correlation between success in academic labs and clinical outcomes. What works in vitro doesn’t always work in animals. What works in animals often doesn’t work in humans. There is no clean, linear pathway that translates great science into approved therapies. Anyone who says otherwise is either new to the field or selling something.</p>
<p>
<p>This is where VCs need to check their ego. We are not the experts in the room. The founder is.</p>
<p>
<p>The best founders we meet are deep domain experts. They’ve lived with the science. They’ve been through the uncertainty. They’re not claiming to have all the answers, but they’ve asked better questions than we ever could. When we show up to those conversations pretending we understand every technical detail or jumping ahead to predictions about commercial success, we’re not adding value. We’re getting in the way.</p>
<p>
<p>Early-stage investing, especially in therapeutics, demands a different posture. It requires listening. It means admitting you don’t fully understand everything. It means asking real questions, not performative ones. And most of all, it means being willing to learn, slowly, expensively, sometimes painfully, alongside the founders. That’s the unspoken truth about venture capital: learning along the way is the expensive secret sauce. You can’t shortcut it. You don’t get to be right just because you wrote the check. You earn insight the hard way, by following the work, living with the uncertainty, and being intellectually honest about what you don’t know.</p>
<p>Some of the best investments we’ve made started with a conversation where we said, “We don’t fully understand this, but we’re interested. Teach us.” That mindset has served us far better than trying to play expert. Drug development doesn’t reward arrogance. It rewards discipline, humility, and patience.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean abandoning judgment or letting go of diligence. It means recognizing that our edge as investors doesn’t come from knowing everything. It comes from knowing when to shut up and listen. It comes from picking founders we trust, not just scientifically, but operationally and ethically, and backing them when the rest of the world isn’t sure yet.</p>

<p>If there’s one lesson we’d offer other investors, it’s this: the smartest guy in the room usually loses. Because the moment you stop being curious, the moment you stop learning, the moment you think you’ve got it all figured out, you’ve already lost the plot.</p>

<p>Let founders lead. Treat their expertise with respect. And be willing to admit that your role is not to predict the future, but to help build it, uncertainty and all.</p>
